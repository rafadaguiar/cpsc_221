Questions:

(For the explanations, generally a sentence or two should be enough.)

1.  Could BFS solve Wolf-Goat-Cabbage, using NullDict?
        ## Yes, it finishes the program with the right answer. 
        --Although it completely ignored the rules of the game. 
    
2.  What happened when you tried to use DFS to solve Wolf-Goat-Cabbage
using NullDict?  Briefly explain why this happened.
        ## It kept bringing the goat from one side of the river to the other(infinite loop). 

3.  Which of BFS, DFS, and BestFS (using the TodoList implementations
we provided) correctly solve Wolf-Goat-Cabbage, using LinkedListDict?
        ## All three of them.
4.  Could BFS solve Sudoku?  What happened?  Briefly explain why.
        --## No. It looked like it was doing the right job, but it was painfully slow.
5.  Could DFS solve Sudoku?  What happened?  Briefly explain why.
        ## Yes. Solved the problem fast.
6.  Could BestFS solve Sudoku?
        ## Yes, and fast.
7.  Using LinkedListDict, try using BFS and DFS to solve the 3x3
Slider Puzzle.  What happened?
    ## They runned over 10min, consumed alot of memory and didn't finish.
8.  Using LinkedListDict, try using BestFS to solve the 3x3
Slider Puzzle.  How long did this take?
    ## 0.139s
9.  Using LinkedListDict, use BestFS to solve the 3x4 and 4x4
Slider Puzzles we provided.  How long did these take?  Which
computer did you use?
    ## 3x4(1.781s), 4x4(3minutes and 2.692s)
    ## MacbookAir(I5 1.7GHz,4GB RAM)
10. Explain your results from Question 7.

We will also be checking whether you have correctly implemented
the ArrayQueue (with the exception of ensure_capacity, which you can leave until the final submission), LinkedListStack and BSTDict classes.
