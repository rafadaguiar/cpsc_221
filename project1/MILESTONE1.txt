Questions:

(For the explanations, generally a sentence or two should be enough.)

1.  Could BFS solve Wolf-Goat-Cabbage, using NullDict?
    No, it doesn't keep track of the states and it ends up bouncing between Wolf-Goat-Cabbage
    (sometimes even moving one of the three without the boat).

2.  What happened when you tried to use DFS to solve Wolf-Goat-Cabbage
using NullDict?  Briefly explain why this happened.
    It kept bringing the goat from one side of the river to the other. 

3.  Which of BFS, DFS, and BestFS (using the TodoList implementations
we provided) correctly solve Wolf-Goat-Cabbage, using LinkedListDict?

4.  Could BFS solve Sudoku?  What happened?  Briefly explain why.

5.  Could DFS solve Sudoku?  What happened?  Briefly explain why.

6.  Could BestFS solve Sudoku?

7.  Using LinkedListDict, try using BFS and DFS to solve the 3x3
Slider Puzzle.  What happened?

8.  Using LinkedListDict, try using BestFS to solve the 3x3
Slider Puzzle.  How long did this take?

9.  Using LinkedListDict, use BestFS to solve the 3x4 and 4x4
Slider Puzzles we provided.  How long did these take?  Which
computer did you use?

10. Explain your results from Question 7.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

We will also be checking whether you have correctly implemented
the ArrayQueue (with the exception of ensure_capacity, which you can leave until the final submission), LinkedListStack and BSTDict classes.
